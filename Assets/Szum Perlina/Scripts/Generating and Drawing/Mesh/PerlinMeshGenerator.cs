        //I want the whole Mesh to be centered (i.e. the 0,0,0 cooridnates of the local position of the object "holding" this mesh is supposed to be in the middle of this mesh) thus I have to make sure that the range of X coordinates is (-HalfOfWidth;HalfOfWidth), with both ends inclusive. Same goes for Z coordinates, their range is supposed to be (-HalfOfHeight;HalfOfHeight), where -HalfOfHeight is at the bottom and HalfOfHeight is at the top. By giving the vertices such X and Y coordinates, I make sure that they are offset by said amount resulting in the object's localPosition of 0,0,0 to be in the center of generated mesh, instead of the bottom left conrner. That's why I need the coords of the first X coordinate and then add to it, and the topMostZ and then subtract from it.
